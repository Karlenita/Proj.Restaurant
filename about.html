She learned to cook as a preteen under the tutiledge of her loving grandmother, Mable. All the young ones in her home had the privilege of learning the art of cooking from a master chef. Yes, she could school Chef Ramsey though she had no formal  training.  Everyone loved to eat her tasty delights and would always come back for more. Karlene desired to pursue the cullinary arts in order to open her own restaurant and serve her grandma's faves in New York City. However, that dream was deferred because she was encouraged to attend law or medical scool instead of pursuing what truly interested her. After working as an educator for 20+ years, Ms. Brown decided to pursue her passion and that led to the opening of her premiere eatery, Dunns River in 2018 in Peekskill, NY. In March of this year, her second enterprise, Fern Gully, opened its door in Newburgh, NY. The hearty, well-seasoned dishes that are prepared and served in her establishments offer a mouth-watering taste of Jamaican cuisine. Crowd favorites include the savory and socculent oxtail and curried goat dishes that have beeen described as "the best in the hudson valley."  The aroma of her jerk chicken will draw you in from blocks away. Her mission is to serve the most authentic Jamaican cuisine paired with excellent customer service, and to feed the homeless in local communities. Please come and taste the authentic jerk chicken that neighbors are always raving about. This joint may be crowded but it's worth the wait. You will be glad that you did!!</p>
